//! # Feature Adaptive Representation
//! `Far` is the primary API layer for processing client-supplied mesh data into
//! subdivided surfaces.
//!
//! The `far` interface may be used directly and also may be used to prepare
//! mesh data for further processing by [`osd`](crate::osd).  The two main
//! aspects of the subdivision process are *Topology Refinement* and *Primvar
//! Refinement*.
//!
//! ## Topology Refinement
//! *Topology refinement* is the process of splitting the mesh topology
//! according to the specified subdivison rules to generate new topological
//! vertices, edges, and faces.
//!
//! This process is purely topological and does not depend on the speciific
//! values of any primvar data (point positions, etc.). Topology refinement can
//! be either uniform or adaptive, where extraordinary features are
//! automatically isolated (see feature adaptive subdivision).
//!
//! The main data structures in `far` related to topology refinement are:
//!
//! * [`TopologyDescriptor`] – Describes a mesh.
//! * [`TopologyRefiner`](crate::far::topology_refiner::TopologyRefiner) –
//!   Encapsulates mesh refinement.
//! * [`TopologyLevel`](crate::far::topology_level::TopologyLevel) – Representis
//!   one level of refinement within a `TopologyRefiner`.
//!
//! ## Primvar Refinement
//! *Primitive Variable* (primvar) *refinement* is the process of computing
//! values for primvar data (points, colors, normals, texture coordinates, etc.)
//! by applying weights determined by the specified subdivision rules.
//!
//! There are many advantages gained by distinguishing between topology
//! refinement and primvar interpolation including the ability to apply a single
//! static topological refinement to multiple primvar instances or to different
//! animated primvar time samples. `Far` supports methods to refine primvar data
//! at the locations of topological vertices and at arbitrary locations on the
//! subdivision limit surface.
//!
//! The main data structures in `far` related to primvar refinement are:
//! * [`PrimvarRefiner`] –  Implements refinement of primvar data at the
//!   locations of topological vertices.
//! * `PatchTable` –        A representation of the refined surface topology
//!   that can be used for efficient evaluation of primvar data at arbitrary
//!   locations.
//! * [`StencilTable`] –    A representation of refinement weights suitable for
//!   efficient parallel processing of primvar refinement.
//! * `LimitStencilTable` – A representation of refinement weights suitable for
//!   efficient parallel processing of primvar refinement at arbitrary limit
//!   surface locations.
